# Employee Database with SQL Analysis

the "retirement wave" as many of their current employees reach the retirement age. The goal was to discover which employees would be 
retiring as well as the number of employees who would be eligible to participate in a metorship program. As many employees retire one 
the goals of Pewlett-Hackard was to ensure that they are able to secure metorship for the new hires as well as prepare for a retirement 
benefits program for the retirees. By using SQL we are able to analyze the employee data and uncover some key findings which help HR 
understand how to better prepare and better serve their employees.
